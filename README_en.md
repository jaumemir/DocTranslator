🎉 **DocTranslator Pro is now live!** Welcome to experience its enhanced capabilities!

## ✨ Key Advantages of the Pro Version

- **Intelligent Chunking Strategy**: Better recognizes structures such as paragraphs and lists, avoiding breaks mid-sentence or within table rows, thereby improving translation quality and contextual coherence.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Significantly reduces token consumption through more efficient prompt design and injection strategies, effectively lowering translation costs.  
- **Termbase Support**: Allows users to define custom terminology glossaries to ensure accuracy and consistency in translating specialized terms.  
- **Translation Memory**: Intelligently reuses previous translations to boost efficiency and reduce costs.  
- **AI Model Provider Management**: Supports configuration of multiple large language models including OpenAI, Qwen, and DeepSeek, enabling users to select based on their needs or let the system intelligently route requests.  
- **Batch Processing**: Enables uploading documents and selecting multiple termbases and translation memories for concurrent translation, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy.  
- **Usage Analytics**: Provides management dashboard features such as token consumption statistics.

## 🚀 Local Development

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mingchen666/DocTranslator.git
cd DocTranslator
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Fill in the necessary environment variables in the `backend/.env` file.

### 3. Start the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Backend

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Start the Frontend and Admin Panel
> **The /dist folder is already built and ready for deployment. If not developing locally, you can skip the following steps.**

*Frontend*

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

*Admin Panel*

```bash
cd admin
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### 6. Access the Project

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:1475  
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8081  
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000  

### 7. Default Admin Credentials

On first startup, the system automatically initializes the database with the following admin account:

```
Email: admin
Password: 123456
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Please change the default password immediately after first login. For production environments, it is recommended to implement password hashing (the system currently stores passwords in plain text).
